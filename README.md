# unblock-imgur

Loads Imgur content from DuckDuckGo proxy with basic functionality

## What this extension does
This extension will redirect all imgur image links to duckduckgo proxy links, allowing it to work in regions where imgur is banned.

### How I made this extension
I forked the extension by erdemolcay, then used AI to make it work with embedded images and function on firefox.

### Why did I use AI?
I have no idea how to use Javascript, and I have no current plans to learn how to do so. But I wanted to get a fix out there for the recent imgur ban, so I used AI. I will always put a disclaimer in if I use AI for something here on github.

### Does this extension fully work?
It does not work with Imgur embedded galleries, so those may either not show up or error out depending on your browser.

## How to install
(This process will be simplified in the future, for now it's pretty manual. Also, this probably doesn't work on mobile, sorry)  
Download this extension from [the releases page](https://github.com/Kraggle09/unblock-imgur/releases), and unzip it.

### Chrome, Edge, and other Chromium browsers
Click the 3 dots in the top right corner, extensions, and manage extensions. 

Turn on developer mode. Click "Load Unpacked", and choose the unzipped folder.

Imgur images should now be redirected to duckduckgo ones.

### Firefox
**WIP**
